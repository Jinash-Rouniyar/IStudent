# HackGT Project - IStudent

Submitted by: Team FaroundFout (Jinash Rouniyar, Aayush Kumar)

## Summary

**As international students staying off campus, we face difficulty in finding suitable housing and setting up essential services. Therefore, we often have to rely on our acquaintances to help us navigate through this uncertain situation. To help address this issue, we have created a web application named Istudent. Istudent aims to provide an all-in-one solution to help students independently navigate and adapt to a new lifestyle. This app would provide personalized recommendations based on individual needs.


## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- A login page that compares the records with existing databases in MYSQL
- A Personalized Recommendation generated with the help of the OpenAI's API
- An integrated map feature to help navigate around the city
- A community tab that will help match students based on their public records and interest


## Video Demo

## Notes
We believe that this is a long-term project and that we will continue working on it in the future.
